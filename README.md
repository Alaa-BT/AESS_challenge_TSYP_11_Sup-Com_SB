# Human Exploration Rover Challenge 
## General description 
In the vast realm of space exploration, Human Exploration rovers seek to overcome formidable challenges like navigating diverse and challenging landscapes from the rocky terrains of Mars to the irregular surfaces of asteroids and the icy depths of moons. The objective of this challenge is to design a rover with innovative and advanced features to explore an extraterrestrial environment and be able to overcome challenges and difficulties related to that specific environment.
## Our solution
## Impetus: the asteroid exploration rover
### Introduction: 
Welcome to Impetus, the forefront of innovation in asteroid exploration. In the pursuit of conquering the challenges posed by extraterrestrial landscapes, Impetus stands as a beacon of cutting-edge technology and engineering excellence. Inspired by the grandeur of space exploration, our rover is meticulously crafted to navigate the intricacies of asteroid environments, where irregular surfaces and unique conditions demand unparalleled innovation.
Impetus embodies the spirit of overcoming challenges, pushing the boundaries of exploration, and contributing to the ever-expanding knowledge of asteroids - our celestial neighbors. In this challenge, we present a rover designed not just to traverse extraterrestrial landscapes but to redefine the standards of adaptability, precision, and resilience in the face of the unknown.
### Context:
### The Asteroid environment:
Asteroids, often referred to as the remnants of the early solar system, are celestial bodies that orbit the sun, primarily located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, which is our main target.

These rocky and metallic objects vary widely in size, shape, and composition, forming a diverse population with unique geological features.
The surfaces of asteroids present a challenging terrain for exploration, characterized by rugged landscapes marked with craters, boulders, and irregular topography. Due to their small size and low gravity, asteroids lack the geological processes that typically smooth surfaces on larger bodies, resulting in a visually complex and challenging environment.
